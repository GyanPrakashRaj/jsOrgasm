NAMASTE Coders!

Today I'm going to create my first web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript).

Honestly, I just strated learning JavaScript and created a functional Weather App with ease.

You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML, a bit CSS (like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc).

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? but trust me that won't be of a big problem.

Let's me explain more about the application I build; my weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (SITAMARHI, IN). The cool thing is that when the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons we're going to use for our web application are created by the Graphic Designer Jager

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

Well, Thats all.
                Thank you.
